        <h1>Virtual Banking Software</h1>
    	
        <h3>Simulated a virtual bank using C++ and object-oriented design principles. The objects that were 
	created included a BankAccount, a Bank, and a Teller. The BankAccount object included private variables,
	as well as accessors and mutators for an account number, account balance, the name of the acount holder,
	and the time that the account was opened. The Bank object included the name of the bank, the ID of
	the bank, and a vector of Bank Account objects. The Bank Object also included a method that read in 
	data from a file, and intialized a Bank Acount from the file. A similar file method wrote out all the
	bank account information at the end of the session to another file. The Teller Object simply consisted
	of a Bank object, and performed all the manipulations to the Bank Accounts within the bank. </h3>

    	 <h1>Virtual Rube Goldberg Machine</h1>
    	
        <h3>Created and rendered an original Rube Goldberg Machine in Autodesk 
	Maya. First, all the structures of the scene were created and modeled 
	using polygon shapes, in coordination with the physics required to 
	accurately portray the scene. Next, the textures for all the materials 
	were applied and edited. Lastly, the camera for the scene was created, 
	and edited in such a manner to capture the entity of the scene in a
	captivating and effective manner.</h3>
