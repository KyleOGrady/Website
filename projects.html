		<h3>The Shapes Are Right; Java</h3>
		<img src="images/shapes_are_right.png"/>
		<p>For this project, I divulged into the world of simple games, with the intention of creating an alternative version of 
		"The Price is Right". Titled "The Shapes Are Right", this computer application was created in Java, utilizing the JavaFX 
		framework. At the launch of the application, the user is prompted to choose a number of shapes to play with. The user then
		selects between a variety of four different shapes, and four different colors. When the game starts, a random permutation
		of the selected shapes and colors are displayed, but covered by a card. The user must guess a combination of the shape and
		color that will be revealed by the current card. For every correct guess, the user is awarded one point. After three trials
		of guessing, the user's final score is tallied and displayed.</p>

		<h3>Virtual Bank Software; C++</h3>
		<img src="images/bank.png"/>
		<p class = "padding-footer">
		This virtual bank was implemented in C++, using various text-editors on one of Clarkson's Unix servers. The primary purpose
		of this project was to explore the capabilities of object-oriented programming. In order to closly mimic the operations of a
		bank, three different classes/objects were created; a bankaccount, a bank, and a teller. Each class contains a header file, 
		where all the private variables and methods are laid out, and an implementation file, which contains all of the code that runs
		the object. In the executable testing file for the project, a teller object is created, which is connected to a bank. The bank
		is populated with bank accounts from a text file. When the testing file is run, users have the ability to check funds, withdraw
		funds, and add or delete bank accounts. </p>
