			Kyle O’Grady was born on January 8th, 1996 in Burlington Vermont. Growing up in nearby Jericho, he spent much of his childhood outdoors, shooting homemade videos with his friends. This early experience developed into a fascination with digital media and computers, and eventually led him to double major in Digital Arts and Sciences, and Computer Science at Clarkson University.
		</p>
		<p>
			After three years at Clarkson, O’Grady decided to return to Vermont over the summer of 2017, working as an Automation Engineer Intern for Allscripts in Burlington. This experience granted him a view into the world of professional software development, as he worked to write Selenium automation scripts to test Allscripts’ EHR software, TouchWorks. 
		</p>
		<p>
			O’Grady has developed many personal, and team projects while at Clarkson. These include but are not limited to a JavaFX graphical user interface that simulates a modified version of The Price is Right, a C++ object-oriented bank simulation, and numerous websites. As of the fall 2017 semester, he is currently working as a team leader in developing a navigational application for Clarkson’s campus.
